The following Storage Account types are supported:

                    -Standard_LRS
                    -Standard_GRS
                    -Standard_RAGRS

The following VMs are supported:

                    -Standard_D3
                    -Standard_D4
                    -Standard_D3_v2
                    -Standard_D4_v2
                    -Standard_A4

                    -Standard_DS4_v2
        
NOTE: Make sure the VMs are supported in the specific Storage Account Type and Azure Region.

REQUIREMNTS:
- The firewall is put into an existing Availability Set that needs to be provided during deploymnet.  The Availability Set is tied to Ethernet 1, which is normally a Untrust Zone.
- A Load Balancer with Backend Pools must be created and those names are required during the deployment.  This template expects the Load Balancer to be in the same resource group as the firewall.
- The storage account and VNET must be created before deploying this template.
